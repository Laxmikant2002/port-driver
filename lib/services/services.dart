/// Modern Services Architecture
/// 
/// This file provides a clean, organized export of all services
/// following modern Flutter/Dart patterns and best practices.

// Core service interfaces and utilities
export 'core/service_interface.dart';

// Service modules
export 'document/document.dart';
export 'location/location.dart';
export 'earnings/earnings.dart';
export 'offline/offline.dart';
export 'trip_history/trip_history.dart';
// Note: notification.dart and analytics.dart exports are commented out due to type conflicts
// export 'notification/notification.dart';
// export 'analytics/analytics.dart';
// export 'network/network.dart';
// export 'system/system.dart';

// Note: Service registry and factory classes removed due to undefined service modules
// These will be re-implemented when the service modules are properly defined
